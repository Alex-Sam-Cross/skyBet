# SkyBet Technical Challenge

### Technology Choices

I have decided to build the app with React, run the tests with Jest and use Webpack for module bundling. 
The reason I chose React is because I'm confident building apps with JavaScript and React and I enjoy using the component-based UI. 
I used Jest for testing.

### What I would add/improve with more time

### How to run the app

Please make sure to have Node v6 or higher and Docker installed and running:

1) Install dependencies:

```javascript
npm install
```

2) Spin up the Docker container:

```javascript
docker-compose up
```

3) Start the app (in a separate terminal window), Navigate to localhost:9090 in the browser if it fails to open automatically:

```javascript
npm start
```
5) To run the unit test:

```javascript
npm test
```
